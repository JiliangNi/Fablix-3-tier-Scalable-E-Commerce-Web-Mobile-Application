script name:
get.py

usage:
Read TS.txt and TJ.txt files in the same directory with get.py and calculate the average number of all numbers in each TS.txt and TJ.txt file, then produce ave_TJ.txt and ave_TS.txt files which contain only one number representing the average number.

on linux:
run by calling "python get.py", but make sure you put this script into same directory with TS.txt and TJ.txt files.
